# Tweet Canonical

A bookmarklet to parse the current page in your browser for a [RevCanonical link](http://revcanonical.wordpress.com/) and send that to Twitter as the base of a tweet.

## The concept

I love Flickr's new Twitter integration and I use it all the time, but sometimes I want to tweet about a photo with my own message rather than the photo's title.

This will work for any page with a RevCanonical link, not just Flickr.

## Installation
You can install the bookmarklet from [a post on my tumblelog](http://lachstock.tumblr.com/post/138909645/tweet-canonical).

(I can't get Markdown to escape the bookmarklet code, if anybody has any tips, please ping me.)

### Customisation
If you want to modify and build your own bookmarklet, just paste the raw JS into a bookmarklet builder such as [this](http://subsimple.com/bookmarklets/jsbuilder.htm). It'll save you heaps of time with encoding and minifying.

You can also hit up [Simon Willison's excellent post](http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/) to find out about his own bookmarklet which creates links using RevCanonical and falls back to TinyUrl if necessary. (Wish I'd remembered about that one before writing mine - would have made it a mite easier!)
